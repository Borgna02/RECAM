# **Energy Management Autonomic System of a Community**

## **Introduction**
The **Energy Management Autonomic System of a Community** is a distributed, autonomous system designed to optimize the management of renewable energy resources such as solar panels and wind turbines. The system focuses on **maximizing self-consumption**, reducing reliance on external energy sources, and ensuring **fair energy distribution** among community members.

The system utilizes a proactive approach to balance energy production, consumption, and storage. Key technologies include:
- **MQTT** for lightweight, real-time communication between components.
- **InfluxDB** for storing time-series data and performing trend analysis.
- **Grafana** for visualizing real-time energy metrics and trends.

An important aspect of the system is the **predictive model** used for forecasting energy trends. The chosen model is based on **Random Forest**, a powerful ensemble learning method that is well-suited for handling complex, non-linear relationships between multiple variables.

## **Energy Prediction Models**
### **Predictive Model Choice: Random Forest**
After analyzing historical data and environmental variables (e.g., temperature, wind speed, solar radiation), we selected **Random Forest** as the primary predictive model for energy production and consumption forecasting.

#### **Why Random Forest?**
1. **Handling Complex Data**: Random Forest is well-suited for capturing **non-linear relationships** and complex interactions between multiple variables, such as the relationship between temperature and solar energy production, or wind speed and energy generated by turbines.
2. **Resilience to Overfitting**: Unlike other models, Random Forest reduces overfitting by using multiple decision trees and averaging their predictions. This makes it highly effective for forecasting with complex datasets.
3. **Ease of Implementation**: Random Forest is easy to implement using Python libraries like **Scikit-learn**, providing a powerful yet accessible tool for training and evaluating models.

### **System Architecture**
The system operates within a **distributed autonomic management architecture**, comprising:
- **Sensors**: Collect real-time data on energy production, consumption, and environmental conditions.
- **Local Managers**: Oversee specific resources, such as solar panels or battery storage, and make decisions based on incoming data.
- **Global Coordination**: Local managers communicate via **MQTT** to align on strategies and share relevant data.
- **Data Storage**: All data is stored in **InfluxDB**, enabling fast and efficient access for analysis.
- **Visualization**: **Grafana** dashboards provide insights into energy metrics, trends, and potential issues.

## **Levels of Intervention**
1. **Basic Level**:  
   - All parameters are within acceptable limits.
   - The system monitors data without taking active measures.

2. **Adjustment Level**:  
   - Predicts potential threshold breaches.
   - Implements low-level interventions, such as adjusting device usage or modifying storage strategies.

3. **Critical Level**:  
   - Detects or predicts dangerous imbalances (e.g., low battery levels or high consumption).
   - Activates emergency measures, such as importing energy from the grid or sending alerts to users.

## **MAPE-K Loop Implementation**
The system is structured around the **MAPE-K loop** (Monitor, Analyze, Plan, Execute, Knowledge), ensuring clear separation of tasks and adaptive behavior:
1. **Monitor**: Collects real-time data from sensors and stores it in **InfluxDB**.
2. **Analyze**: Processes historical and real-time data to detect trends and predict future states using **Random Forest**.
3. **Plan**: Develops strategies to adjust production, consumption, and storage based on analysis results.
4. **Execute**: Implements strategies through actuators, such as controlling appliances or managing grid interaction.
5. **Knowledge**: Centralized storage of historical data, rules, and thresholds to support decision-making.

## **Components Implementation**
1. **Monitoring**:  
   - Subscribes to **MQTT** topics to gather energy data from sensors.
   - Stores the collected data in **InfluxDB** for further analysis.

2. **Analysis**:  
   - Uses **Random Forest** to predict energy trends based on historical and real-time data.
   - Detects imbalances and publishes findings to **MQTT** topics for the planner to take action.

3. **Planning**:  
   - Creates plans to address issues such as charging batteries or reducing consumption.
   - Publishes these plans via **MQTT** for execution.

4. **Execution**:  
   - Executes plans through actuators, such as adjusting device consumption or managing grid interaction.
