# Machine learning with applications to autonomous systems

Machine learning methods play an important role in discovering knowledge from observed data, which enables adaptive sensing, modeling, planning, and control for autonomous systems. Due to the increasing complexity of real-world applications, it is necessary for autonomous systems to have improved learning abilities such as online learning and learning from imbalanced data for sensing, planning, and motion control.
This special issue on "Machine Learning with Applications to Autonomous Systems" focuses on new machine learning theory and algorithms with applications to autonomous systems. There are the three major areas addressed in the special issue: 
* developing new machine learning algorithms for autonomous sensing and modeling 
* investigating learning-based solutions for autonomous sensing problems
* addressing learning-based control problems in autonomous systems.
